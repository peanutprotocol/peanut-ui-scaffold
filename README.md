# peanut-ui-scaffold
This is a very basic implementation of the peanut SDK in a nextjs app. 

## Getting Started

First install the dependencies (location: root folder):

```bash
yarn install
# or
npm install
```

Secondly, copy the .env.example to .env. The only required var is a Walletconnect project ID but we've provided one for you:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Lastly, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
