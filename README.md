# peanut-ui-scaffold

This is a very basic implementation of the peanut SDK in a nextjs app.

## Getting Started

First install the dependencies (location: root folder):

```bash
yarn install
# or
npm install
```

Secondly, copy the .env.example to .env. We've provided you with a walletconnect project id and a peanut project id. You can use these for testing purposes. If you want to use your own project id's, you can create a project at [walletconnect.org](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/app) and contact us to get your own

````bash

```bash
cp .env.example .env
````

Lastly, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
